If you decide to use any of these I recommend you talk to me (Tim).
I promise to clean this up later.

Included is not just table creation, but some useful troubleshooting tools

Run josh's table creation files to make the "neapolitan" table scheme before trying to insert data


There is a divide by zero bug in the MVPatientResponsibility I promise to fix this later. creates 5 bad entries
since 5 procedures are totally free.

each class has a description at the top, hopefully this is all you need to know to run them

I ran all of these from eclipse so I didn't make any scripts. Its easy to do, but not worth the effort
since I plan on changing all of this. Which is also why I didn't pretty it up for you guys.
