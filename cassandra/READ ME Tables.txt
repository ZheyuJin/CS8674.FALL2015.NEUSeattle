#MAIN TABLES
###providers table 
* can be downloaded here: <https://www.dropbox.com/s/lva4xf39fy6vwdg/providers.tar.gz?dl=0>
* contains all the avaliable information related to a provider

    CREATE TABLE providers ( 
	npi text PRIMARY KEY, 
	medicare_participation_indicator text,
	nppes_credentials text, 
	nppes_entity_code text, 
	nppes_provider_city text,
	nppes_provider_country text, 	
	nppes_provider_first_name text,
	nppes_provider_gender text,  
	nppes_provider_last_org_name text,
	nppes_provider_mi text, 
	nppes_provider_state text, 
	nppes_provider_street1 text, 
	nppes_provider_street2 text, 
	nppes_provider_zip text, 
	procedures list<text>,
	provider_type text 
    );

* npi is a unique identifier for the provider
* medicare participation indicator is either Y or N, and indicates if the provider participates in the medicare program, participants
are reimbursed by medicare at a higher rate, but have a lower allowed amount.
* credentials are the degree or qualification (e.g. MD)
* entity code ?????
* last org name either refers to the individial provider's last name or the organizations name
* state is the two letter postal abreviations and includes all 50 states as well as territories 
* zip includes 5 digit and extended US zipcodes as well as foreign zip codes
* procedures is a list of procedures performed by that provider in 2012 for which medicare was charged
* provider type indicates the speciality (e.g. Neurology)


###proceduresstats
* can be downloaded here: <https://www.dropbox.com/s/pcvej5u9yy5einc/proceduresstats.tar.gz?dl=0>
* contains the available information for a particular procedure performed by a particular provider at either office or facility

    CREATE TABLE proceduresStats (
	id text PRIMARY KEY, 
	average_Medicare_allowed_amt float, 
	average_Medicare_payment_amt float, 
	average_submitted_chrg_amt float,
 	bene_day_srvc_cnt float,
	bene_unique_cnt float, 
	hcpcs_code text,  
	line_srvc_cnt float, 
	npi text, 
	place_of_service text, 
	stdev_Medicare_allowed_amt float, 
	stdev_Medicare_payment_amt float, 
	stdev_submitted_chrg_amt float,
	year int	
    );

* id is a unique key representing a concatination of npi, place_of_service, hcpcs_code, and year
* average medicare allowed amt is the average medicare allowed this provider to charge for this procedure. That is, this
is what the physician recieves for the procedure. This amount is capped by Medicare and it represents what Medicare pays
plus what the patient is responsible for (including what the patient's suplimental insurance pays). 
* average medicare payment amt is the average amount medicare reimbursed for this procedure. This is how much Medicare
pays, which is usually only part of the total cost of the procedure. 
* average submitted chrg amt is the average amount this provider submitted for this procedure. This is usually
the standard amount the provider charges for the procedure, but is not what the physican actually recieves 
because medicare caps how much a provider can recieve for a procedure. This number gives an indication of the provider's
pricing, but is generally much higher than what the provider recieves. 
* bene_day_srvc_cnt : this number is determined by taking the unique patients who recieved the procedure in a day and suming 
them for the year. If the same patient revieves multiple of the same procedure in the same day that patient is only counted once,
but if the procedures are spaced over multiple days, the count increases for each day the patient visits. It is an approximation for the number of patient visits. 
bene_unique_cnt : this is the number of unique patients who recieved the procedure for that provider in the year. It doesn't matter how many
times the patient recieved the procedure or if the patient had the same procedure on multiple days of the year, the patient is only counted once. 
* hcpcs_code is a unique identifier for the procedure 
* line_srvc_cnt : this is the number fo times a procedure is performed. If the same procedure is performed on the same patient multiple times it is counted
that same number of times, even if done during the same visit, it gets counted each time. 
* npi is a unique identifier for the provider
* place_of_service : is either O for office or F for facility. Reimbursment rates are slightly different for Office and Facility visits. Also facilities often
have additional charges not included in this table which may or may not be covered by medicare
* stdev_Medicare_allowed_amt - standard deviation of allowed amount
* stdev_Medicare_payment_amt - standard deviation of payment amount
* stdev_submitted_chrg_amt - standard deviation of submitted amount

###proceduresinfo
* can be downloaded here: <https://www.dropbox.com/s/l36dl23jt4plsp1/proceduresinfo?dl=0>
* contains information relevant to a procedure type

    CREATE TABLE proceduresInfo ( 
	hcpcs_code text PRIMARY KEY, 
	hcpcs_description text,
	hcpcs_drug_indicator text 
    );

* hcpcs_code is a unique identifier for a procedure
* hcpcs_description describes the procedure
* hcpcs_drug_indicator Y/N, indicates if the procedure is the administration of a drug



#ACCESORY TABLES

###mv_providers_cost
* can be downloaded here: <https://www.dropbox.com/s/uj2gkqridr0kino/mv_providers_cost.tar.gz?dl=0>
* The cost of a procedure for a provider in a given state in order of cost
* missing some values, see DrNull below

###mv_providers_cost_national
* can be downloaded here: <https://www.dropbox.com/s/x8777paqh1aadzw/mv_providers_cost_national.tar.gz?dl=0>
* the cost of a procedure for a provider in order of cost (independent of state)
* Note that though our implementation uses two tables, a better strategy would be to add a secondary index for the 
states in this table and replace "mv_providers_cost" with this table
* missing some values, see DrNull below

###mv_procedures_state_cost_2012
* can be downloaded here: <https://www.dropbox.com/s/htc412mpbild57o/mv_procedures_state_cost_2012.tar.gz?dl=0>
* the average cost of a procedure in a state
* believe this table has values with extra whitespace, may need to be regenerated if choose to use it

###DrNull additional data for mv_providers_cost and mv_providers_cost_national
* can be downloaded here: <https://www.dropbox.com/s/3ui4rsedqtttnzu/DrNull?dl=0>
* mv_providers_cost_national and mv_providers_cost do not allow nppes_provider_last_org_name to be NULL, but some
providers have a last name which is literally the string "NULL", but are missread as being null values when we 
attempt to use copy table. There are likely better ways of handling this, but as a quick fix, these names were 
removed from the table and inserted back in from this list via insertion statements.
* Run insert into statements from this table to complete the mv_providers_cost_national or mv_providers_cost tables.
